My name is Derrick Gilland. I'm a professional software developer and open source contributor. My programming specialties include `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `JavaScript <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_ with a focus on full-stack web development but I have been known to dabble in `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/>`_ and `PHP <http://php.net/>`_. I'm experienced with several database servers including `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_, `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_, and `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_. On the DevOps side, I routinely commission Linux servers, execute application deployment strategies, and set up server performance monitoring.
