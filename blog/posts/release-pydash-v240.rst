Today I released `pydash v2.4.0 <https://github.com/dgilland/pydash/tree/v2.4.0>`_. It was a minor release with a few new ``string`` methods. The full changelog is below.


v2.4.0 (2015-01-07)
-------------------

- Add ``ensure_ends_with``.
- Add ``ensure_starts_with``.
- Add ``quote``.
- Add ``surround``.


Work on the next `major release (v3) <https://github.com/dgilland/pydash/milestones/v3.0.0>`_ is currently underway. It will be a backwards incompatible change.
