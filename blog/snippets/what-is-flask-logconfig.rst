What is Flask-LogConfig?
------------------------

Flask-LogConfig is a `Flask <flask.pocoo.org>`_ extension that easily configures application logging. Under the hood it uses `logconfig <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/logconfig/>`_ to support loading configurations from a ``dict``, ``json`` file, ``yaml`` file, or a ``config parser`` file. It also supports converting any synchronous log handler into an asynchronous one using threads.

It is Python 2.6+ and 3.3+ compatible.
