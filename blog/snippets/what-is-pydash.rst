Pydash is the kitchen sink of Python utility libraries. It has over 250 general purpose functions that cover things like lists, dicts, collections, functions, numbers, predicates, and strings. It also features lazy method chaining, function pipe creation, and function currying. It has extensive testing with over 1,000 test cases and is Python 2.6+ and 3.3+ compatibile. Originally, a straight port of the `Lo-Dash <https://lodash.com/>`_, pydash has expanded to incorporate much more functionality.
